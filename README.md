# weather-app
An application project for CTK that makes use of Openweathermaps API.

How to use application:

1. Run weather.exe.
2. Enter "localhost:4567" in a browser of your choice. 
3. You're now in the application and can follow the instructions given there.

Using weather.exe requires no installation, but if you wish you can instead start the webserver using the ruby files. 
This requires a working installation of Ruby, as well as the slim and sinatra gems (which can be installed by running 
'gem install slim' and 'gem install sinatra' once you have ruby installed). Once you have the required software
open a CLI and navigate to the directory containing 'controller.rb' and then enter the command 'ruby controller.rb'.
After that you can continue on step 2 of the instructions above.
